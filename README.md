Hi! My name is Tiffany Nguyen and I am an aspiring software developer studying computer science at the University of Oklahoma. Currently, I am learning react to hopefully learn more about frontend! 
Outside of programming, I like to: 
  - listen to music (my fav artist rn is wave to earth :3) ðŸŽµ
  - play the piano & violin ðŸŽ»
  - play videogames (Minecraft!!) ðŸŽ®
  - go to the gym ðŸ’ª

Feel free to reach out/connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffanynguyenb4/ \
I am always aiming for 8 hours of sleep a day.
