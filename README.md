I like experimenting with new technologies, building small projects, and frolicking out and about with my friends 😝 <br>

<br>

#### Here's a list of things I currently busy myself with:
* 👩🏻‍💻 Working as a Machine Learning Intern for the Department of Defense
* 🎒 Sophomore studying Computer Science with a minor in Math and Japanese at the University of Oklahoma
* 📚 Researching LLMs and GUI agents under the best professor ever

<br>
<br>

#### And here are some (ambitious) goals:
* 8 hours of sleep a day 😴
* be good to my parents 🫂
* STUDY ABROAD IN JAPAN!! (Spring 26?) 🇯🇵
