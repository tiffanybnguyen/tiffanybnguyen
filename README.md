I like experimenting with new technologies, building small projects, and frolicking out and about with my friends 😝 <br>

<br>

#### Here's a list of things I currently busy myself with:
* 👩🏻‍💻 Working as a Machine Learning Intern for the Department of Defense
* 🎒 Studying Computer Science with a minor in Math and Japanese at the University of Oklahoma
* 📚 Researching LLMs, NLPs, and GUI agents

#### And here are some (ambitious) goals:
* 😴 get 8 hours of sleep a day
* 🫂 be good to my parents
* 🇯🇵 STUDY ABROAD IN JAPAN!!
